This repository demonstrates a problem with nested routes in React Router v6.  The issue is intermittent; sometimes nested routes render correctly, other times they do not, even without code changes. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, involves using `useLocation` to force a re-render when the parent route changes.  This is a workaround, not a fix for the root cause of the inconsistent behavior.
